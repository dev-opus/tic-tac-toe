# Tic Tac Toe
A simple implementation of the tic tac toe game using:
- HTML
- CSS and 
- JavaScript

to flex my understanding on the concept of creating objects in javascript using **Factory Functions** and the **Module Pattern** as covered in the **Orgainizig your JavaScript Code** section of the Odin's Project JavaScript Curriculum.

(mobile responsive implementation coming soon!!!)
