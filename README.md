# Tic Tac Toe
A simple implementation of the tic tac toe game using:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

to flex my understanding on the concept of creating objects in javascript using **Factory Functions** and the **Module Pattern** as covered in the **Orgainizig your JavaScript Code** section of the Odin's Project JavaScript Curriculum.

PS: This game a decent responsive interface on both mobile and desktop displays!
